# Unblocking [ros3djs/issues/209](https://github.com/RobotWebTools/ros3djs/issues/209)

From the problem statement, our assumption is that there seems to be a misconfiguration in the way @bvobart imported the 3D model. We shall seek to replicate the issue by first attempting to import the ros3djs library and try to import a 3D model into the application.

After setting up the project, we found that the model was loaded successfully without error. It could be that the user was having his own specific problem in regarding to his project setup. With this example sandbox we 209 is unblocked and @bvobart could take a look at our example to solve his problem.
